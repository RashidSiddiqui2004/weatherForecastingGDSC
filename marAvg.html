                So what to wear in March? For visitors traveling to New Delhi we recommend wearing layers. So maybe a
                skirt, t-shirt, shorts for during the day and jeans and a warm jacket for some days and evenings. At
                night it can still cool off so best to pack some warmer nightwear as well.
